				},
				{
					"question": "What does the minify option do?",
					"answer": "Minification removes unnecessary whitespace, line breaks, and comments (optionally) to reduce file size. This is useful for production deployments to improve loading times."
				},
				{
					"question": "How does data extraction work?",
					"answer": "The extract mode traverses the document tree and outputs the path to each element along with its attributes and text content. This is useful for understanding document structure and extracting specific data."
				},
				{
					"question": "What validation is performed?",
					"answer": "The parser checks for well-formedness: proper tag nesting, closed tags, valid attribute syntax, and proper character encoding. It reports any parsing errors found."
				},
				{
					"question": "Can it handle large documents?",
					"answer": "Yes, but very large documents (over 10MB) might be slow to process. The parser runs entirely in your browser, so performance depends on your device's capabilities."

				},
				{
					"question": "What's the difference between camelCase and PascalCase?",
					"answer": "camelCase starts with a lowercase letter (helloWorld), while PascalCase starts with an uppercase letter (HelloWorld). Both are commonly used in programming."
				},
				{
					"question": "When should I use snake_case vs kebab-case?",
					"answer": "snake_case uses underscores and is common in Python and Ruby. kebab-case uses hyphens and is popular in URLs and CSS class names."
				},
				{
					"question": "What is alternating case used for?",

				},
				{
					"question": "Is there a file size limit?",
					"answer": "There's no hard limit, but very large images (over 50MB) might take longer to process. The tool works entirely in your browser, so performance depends on your device."
				},
				{
					"question": "How is aspect ratio calculated?",

					"question": "Can I check multiple images at once?",

					"answer": "Absolutely. All processing happens locally in your browser. No images are uploaded to any server. Your files remain completely private."
