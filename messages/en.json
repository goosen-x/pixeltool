				{

					"answer": "HTML is more forgiving and allows certain unclosed tags, while XML requires strict syntax with all tags properly closed and nested. The parser automatically detects the type based on content."
				},
				{
					"question": "What does the minify option do?",
					"answer": "Minification removes unnecessary whitespace, line breaks, and comments (optionally) to reduce file size. This is useful for production deployments to improve loading times."
				},
				{
					"question": "How does data extraction work?",
					"answer": "The extract mode traverses the document tree and outputs the path to each element along with its attributes and text content. This is useful for understanding document structure and extracting specific data."
				},
				{
					"question": "What validation is performed?",
					"answer": "The parser checks for well-formedness: proper tag nesting, closed tags, valid attribute syntax, and proper character encoding. It reports any parsing errors found."
				},
				{
					"question": "Can it handle large documents?",
					"answer": "Yes, but very large documents (over 10MB) might be slow to process. The parser runs entirely in your browser, so performance depends on your device's capabilities."
